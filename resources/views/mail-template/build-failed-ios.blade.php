Dear {{$details['customer_name']}} ,

<p style="color: black;text-align: justify">
    I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to provide you with an update regarding the development of your iOS app, <b>{{$details['app_name']}}</b>. Unfortunately, we encountered some unexpected issues during the build process, and we were unable to successfully complete the build at this time.
</p>

<p style="color: black;text-align: justify">
    Please go to the <b>“Build App”</b> steps again & try with proper information. Hopefully this time you will find your app successfully
</p>

    Thank you for your patience and understanding as we work through this.
